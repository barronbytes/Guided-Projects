# Static Site Generator

I'm excited to showcase a static site generator I built using Python. This tool lets users upload Markdown, CSS, and image files, which are then processed and converted into fully styled HTML pages.

## Visit The Site

Feel free to check out the [project here](https://barronbytes.github.io/Static-Site-Generator/)!

## Features

**Python Backend:** Used type hinting and `unittest` for 58 edge cases, all of which passed.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

* IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
* Python 3.9 or higher > *for version of type hinting syntax used*
* Bourne Shell compatible OS like Linux or macOS > *Windows users should [download WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)*

## Quick Start

Follow the steps below to correctly setup the project on your local device.

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Locate **content folder** > delete the default files and subfolders
3. Locate **demo folder** > delete folder *(it's not needed for functionality)* 
4. Locate **static folder** > delete the default files and subfolders
5. Locate **README.md file** > edit file contents to your liking

## Usage

Follow three steps to run the program for your custom needs:

### Step 1: Upload Markdown Files

* **File Types:** Only files with the **.md** extension can be saved in the **content folder** and its subfolders.
* **Root Folder:** One file called **index.md** required. Additional files and subfolders allowed.

**Example Folder Structure:**
